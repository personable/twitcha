# Twitcha - the Twitta Switcha(TM)

*Search Twitter for words or phrases. Replace these words or phrases with your own snark.*

Uses Sea of Clouds' [Tweet](http://tweet.seaofclouds.com/) jQuery plugin to query Twitter, then replaces the text in the query with whatever the user's twisted imagination comes up with via [jQuery replaceText](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-replacetext-plugin/).

Huge debt of gratitude to Stan Scates' [Tweet.js-Mod](https://github.com/StanScates/Tweet.js-Mod) for making Tweet work again, after the Twitter public API shutdown.
